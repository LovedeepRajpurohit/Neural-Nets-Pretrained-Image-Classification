   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the notebooks available in this repository and follow the instructions provided in each notebook.

### Example Workflow

1. **Load a pretrained model**: Choose a model like ResNet, VGG, or Inception.
2. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure that the dataset is formatted correctly.
3. **Fine-tune the model**: Use transfer learning to adapt the pretrained model to your dataset.
4. **Evaluate the model**: Generate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
5. **Visualize predictions**: Use built-in tools for visualizing model outputs.
